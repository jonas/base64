#Base64

### Another Base64 encoder / decoder.

This one is 
 + really small
 + not very efficient (the latest version is not too bad)
 + liberal licence (BSD)*,
 + simple API
 + idiomatic scala, and 
 + need not add a dependency to your project.  Just copy the [one source file](https://github.com/marklister/base64/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/Base64.scala) to your project.
 + Scala-js compatible
 + no Dom required
 + works on client or server 
 
#### Getting Started

Using SBT:
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.github.marklister" %% "base64" % "0.2.3"
```
or for scala-js
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.github.marklister" %%% "base64" % "0.2.3"
```

#### API

Simply invoke `toBase64` on an `Array[Byte]`  or `Seq[Byte]` or `ArrayBuffer[Byte]` or

`toByteArray` on a `String` containing a Base64 representation.

####Imports

     import com.github.marklister.base64.Base64.Encoder 
     import com.github.marklister.base64.Base64.Decoder

`com.github.marklister.base64.Base64.Decoder`

or the wildcard:

`com.github.marklister.base64.Base64._`

####Base64 Url

Two encoding schemes are provided as default: `base64` and `base64Url`.  `base64` is the default one.  To select
`base64Url`

Using implicits -- just make the encode/decode scheme available via an implicit:
 
 ```scala
 implicit val encoding = base64Url
 ```
 
 Or you can provide the scheme as an argument to `toByteArray` or `toBase64` eg `toBase64(base64Url)` or `toByteArray(base64)`
  
####Padding

Padding is strict for the `base64` encode scheme and non-strict for `base64Url`

To create a non strict scheme:

```scala
implicit val encoding = base64.copy(strictPadding=false)
```

####Efficiency

This implementation began life as a toy implementation that chose simplicity over efficiency.
The advent of scalaJs meant that the library has a real world target and warranted
improving its efficiency.  Version 0.2.1 improves efficiency greatly but some legacy inefficiencies remain. 

####REPL example

```sbt
[info] Starting scala interpreter...
[info] 
import com.github.marklister.base64.Base64._
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (OpenJDK Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).

scala> "ABCDEFG".getBytes.toBase64 //Encodes Array[Byte]=>String
res0: String = QUJDREVGRw==

scala> res0.toByteArray //Decodes base64 String=>Array[Byte]
res1: Array[Byte] = Array(65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71)

scala> res1.sameElements("ABCDEFG".getBytes)
res2: Boolean = true
```


* At one stage this code was released as public domain but there was some discussion about the validity of public
  domain licences and they don't work on Maven Central.  So now it's BSD.  If you need some other licence then raise an
  issue.
